    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The winds were howling...</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a scream was heard</p>
    <p>You turn around and walk in the direction of the scream to investigate</p>
    <p>You stop at a road, then you see a car crashed into a tree</p>
    <p>Upon moving closer you notice something strange lying in the drivers seat. 
    It appears to be a severed arm, and the seat is covered in blood.</p>
    <p>You follow a trail of blood that leads you to an old cabin, the door is wide open,
    and there is a dim light inside.</p>
    <p>Inside you find a man sitting in a chair holding an axe, he smiles at you,
    you go to run but the door shuts behind you.</p>
