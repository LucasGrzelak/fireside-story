    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The winds were howling...</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a scream was heard.</p>
    <p>You turn around and walk in the direction of the scream to investigate.</p>
    <p>You stop at a road, then you see a car crashed into a tree.</p>
    <p>Upon moving closer you notice something strange lying in the drivers seat. 
    It appears to be a severed arm, and the seat is covered in blood.</p>
    <p>You follow a trail of blood that leads you to an old cabin, the door is wide open, and there is a dim light inside.</p>
